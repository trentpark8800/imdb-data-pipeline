# imdb-data-pipeline
A learning project in using Python and SQL to create a data pipeline for the publicly available IMDB movies datasets.
  
The objective is to learn about how to create an automated batch pipeline using Python and SQL.\
The main tasks involved are:
1. Simulate incoming batch data - using some sort of time event to drop raw data in a storage location.
2. Design a small Data Warehouse to make this data easier for analysis.
3. Clean and stage this data.
4. Transform the staged data.
5. Load the data into a SQL DB for consumption by BI/Data Science applications.
  
This is intented to be a learning exercise about Data Engineering and, more specifically, ETL pipelines.
