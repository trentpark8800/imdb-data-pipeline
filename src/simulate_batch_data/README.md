# Batch Data Simulation
  
The objective is to create a process which simulates the arrival of the IMDB data in batches.
  
The records should:
* Arrive at certain time intervals.
* Should arrive at a storage location - for example within a file/dir.
* Be in a flat-file format - for example json or csv.
* This process should work independently of the rest of the project - after all this is meant to simulate the arrival of data, in the wild this would generally not be in your control.
